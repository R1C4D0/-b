     * This system will automatically start with one commit:
     * a commit that contains no files and has the commit message initial commit (just like that, with no punctuation).
     * It will have a single branch: master,
     * which initially points to this initial commit,
     * and master will be the current branch.
     * The timestamp for this initial commit will be 00:00:00 UTC,
     * Thursday, 1 January 1970 in whatever format you choose for dates
     * <p>
     * In order for Gitlet to work, it will need a place to store old copies of files and other metadata.
     * All of this stuff must be stored in a directory called .gitlet,
     * just as this information is stored in directory .git for the real git system.
     * Most Gitlet commands (except for the init command) only need to work when used from a directory
     * where a Gitlet system has been initialized i.e. a directory that has a .gitlet directory.
     * The files that arenâ€™t in your .gitlet directory
     * (which are copies of files from the repository that you are using and editing,
     * as well as files you plan to add to the repository) are referred to as the files in your working directory.
